# python-experiments
Python programs for speech production / perception experiments

These programs depend on Caterpyllar (http://github.com/crouzet-o/caterpyllar):
a small, _work-in-progress_, Python library for human interface experiments on
speech perception and production.

## displaylist.py

An interface that will display written sequences on screen either in a
Left-to-Right language (as english or french) or in a Right-to-Left language
(only Arabic has been tested).

## progression.py

An interface that will display written sequences along with a progression bar
at various rates. This is used for experimentation on the impact of speech rate
variations on speech production.
